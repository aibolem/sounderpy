‚ùì Troubleshooting
===================


Like any software, SounderPy is prone to errors now and then -- some of them are known with fixes! If you are running into issues using SounderPy, check out this guide to troubleshooting below!

Funky Plot Scaling 
-------------------

When using SounderPy's plot function, sometimes the matplotlib formatting operations the plot functions use (``build_sounding()``, ``build_hodograph()``, ``build_composite()``) don't agree with some screen sizes. This throws off the scaling of the plots when plotting them 'inline'. Thankfully there is a fix! 

Each of SounderPy's plotting functions have a ``save`` key-word-argument (kwarg). By default these are set to *False*, but when setting the kwarg to *True* you can save the plot to a .png file. 

When the plot is saved to a file it will preserve the correct scaling and dimensions. 

The Fix: saving the plot to a file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	Add the ``save=True`` kwarg to your plot function (``build_sounding()``, ``build_hodograph()``, ``build_composite()``). 

	You can optionally add the ``filename`` kwarg that allows you to set a specific filename. By default, this filename is *'sounderpy_sounding.png'*.
